## iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp
**Angela Yu's App Brewery course on Udemy**

I have been meaning to get back into iOS development for quite some time now.  Haven't touched iOS/Swift for a number of years now, since back when I was hosting The Swiftjitsu Podcast (https://soundcloud.com/swiftjitsu) where I was interviewing iOS app developers in 2015.  I should download these audio clips.  I don't have them stored anywhere anymore.  Anyway, today, I'm more python developer for the day-to-day tasks at my current job.  

I bought Angela Yu's iOS & Swift - The complete iOS App Development Bootcamp back in Nov 8, 2022 on Udemy but never started the course.  She's also the founder of The App Brewery (appbrewery.com).  I just couldn't squeeze in the time to start a new course.

Here we are today, March 2023, I finally dusted off my iOS developer account and started working on the course.  This repo are the things I have been working on in the course.  I am still busier than ever but determined to complete the course by chipping away a few hours a day until it's done.   

A lot of what is covered in this course will be review and a lot will be new.  I am going to fast forward for the parts that are already familiar to me and slow down where needed.   Below are the sections of the course:
